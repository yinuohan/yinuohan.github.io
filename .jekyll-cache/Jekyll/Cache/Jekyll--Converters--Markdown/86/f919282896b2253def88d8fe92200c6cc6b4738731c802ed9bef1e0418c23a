I"ì<h2 id="about">About</h2>

<p>Thank you for visiting my research website.</p>

<p>My research mainly intersects with two fields of astronomy. Firstly, I study the formation and evolution of planetary systems by way of imaging and modelling extrasolar belts of planetesimals, which are generally referred to as debris disks. These belts, like the asteroid belt and Kuiper belt in the Solar system, encode clues for when, where and how solid bodies like planets and planetesimals formed and subsequently dynamically evolved.</p>

<p>Secondly, I image and model dust produced by massive stars to understand the mechanisms by which dust is replenished in the interstellar medium. The dust produced by these most massive of binary stars could trace intricate structures in the form of spirals, the detailed geometry of which reveals the physics of stellar wind interactions hidden within the core of these distant systems.</p>

<p>I am currently funded by a GPS Barr Fellowship at Caltech. Prior to this, I completed my PhD at the University of Cambridge on <a href="https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/items/048f54d8-b840-4875-b3ee-5a4199ab706c">debris disks</a>, where I worked with Mark Wyatt as my advisor and was funded by a <a href="https://www.gatescambridge.org">Gates Cambridge Scholarship</a>.</p>
